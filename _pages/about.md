I am a professional data scientist currently working at Accenture Operations. I have graduated from the [Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), where I worked with Prof. [Om P. Damani](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~damani/). I had worked in the area of computer vision, machine learning and software development. My M.Tech research project has been deployed by the PoCRA (Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture), Govt. of Maharashtra. I believe artificial intelligence can save the humanity.
