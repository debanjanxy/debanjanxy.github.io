I am a Data Scientist at Accenture Operations, working in Data and Applied Intelligence team. I have graduated from the [Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), where I worked with Prof. [Om P. Damani](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~damani/) in the area of computer vision, machine learning and software development. My M.Tech research project has been deployed by the [PoCRA (Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture)] (https://dbt.mahapocra.gov.in/), Govt. of Maharashtra. On a different note, I believe artificial intelligence can save the humanity.
