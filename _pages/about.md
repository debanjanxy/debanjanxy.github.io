Hi! I'm Debanjan Das, a Data Scientist at Accenture Operations, working for the Data and Applied Intelligence team. I graduated from the [Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in) where I worked with Prof. [Om P. Damani](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~damani/) in the areas of computer vision, machine learning and software development. My M.Tech research project was recently deployed by [PoCRA](https://dbt.mahapocra.gov.in/) (Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture)], run by the Govt. of Maharashtra. I sincerely believe that Artificial Intelligence can guide humanity to a better future.
