I am a voracious reader with an affinity towards Bengali literature. I prefer mountains over beaches. I have completed a couple of Himalayan treks (~15000 ft) and few local treks in West Bengal and Maharashtra. My musical taste is confined mostly under Indian classical music, Rabindrasangeet, and Bollywood.
